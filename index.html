    <p>My name is Lilian Ngweta. I just completed my junior year at Arizona State university and I will be a senior next semester. I am a Software Engineering major which is under the School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering department. I expect to graduate in May 2018. This summer, I am a DREU Computer Science Research intern at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. I am super excited and thankful for this opportunity because I believe am going to learn a lot. I love to travel and through this opportunity, I got to come to the east coast for the first time. I am excited about the project and my whole experience here on the east coast this summer!

    <p>My Mentor is Professor Andrea Parker. She is a profesor at Northeastern University. Below is her description on who she is and what she does. <br><br> I am an Assistant Professor at Northeastern University, jointly appointed in the College of Computer & Information Science and the Bouve College of Health Sciences. I am the founder and director of the Wellness Technology Research Group and I am part of the core faculty shaping the Personal Health Informatics Ph.D. program.

    In 2012 I completed a postdoctoral fellowship in the Everyday Computing Lab at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I worked with Dr. Elizabeth Mynatt and collaborated with Dr. Veda Johnson at Emory University School of Medicine. I hold a Ph.D. in Human-Centered Computing from the Georgia Institute of Technology and a B.S. in Computer Science from Northeastern University.

     My research contributes to the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), and Health Informatics. I design and evaluate the impact of software tools that help people manage their health and wellness. My research specifically examines ethnic and economic health disparities and the social context of health management. I take an ecological approach to technology design, whereby I conduct in-depth fieldwork to examine the intrapersonal, social, cultural, and environmental factors that influence a person's ability and desire to make healthy decisions--and how technology can support wellness in this context.<br> <br> She is Awesome! <br><br> Professor Andrea's Website: <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/andrea/">http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/andrea/</a> </p>
